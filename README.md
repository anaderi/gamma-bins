# Search for binary gamma stars

The main goal of the project is to find star objects that look similar to binary gamma stars.

## Data
Data about stars is taken from various sources (see details at https://github.com/anaderi/gamma-bins/tree/master/data)
 
## Launching

1. Choose epsilon in definitions.py to control merging catalogs.
2. Run simbad.ipynb -> xmm.ipynb -> search_for_stars.ipynb -> spectrums_xmm.ipynb
